# SIEM Internship – Phase 1: Sysmon Setup & Log Collection

## 📌 Phase Objective

The goal of this phase is to set up a basic cybersecurity lab environment and use Sysmon to generate and collect Windows security logs. This setup forms the foundation for future threat detection and alerting use cases.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Windows Virtual Machine** (Target system)
- **Sysmon** – System Monitor by Sysinternals
- **Event Viewer** – For viewing logs
- `sysmonconfig-v2.xml` – Configuration file for Sysmon
- **GitHub** – For tracking progress and storing documentation/logs

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

### 🔹 1. Download & Install Sysmon

1. Downloaded the Sysmon ZIP package from the [official Microsoft Sysinternals site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon).
2. Extracted the files and saved:
   - `Sysmon64.exe`
   - `sysmonconfig-v2.xml`
3. Opened **Command Prompt** as Administrator.
4. Ran the following command to install Sysmon with the config file:
   Sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig-v2.xml
 5.Confirmed successful installation and verified the Sysmon service is running.

### 🔹 2. Log Collection via Event Viewer Opened:
      Event Viewer → Windows Logs → Security

      Observed the following Event IDs:

       ✅ Event ID 4624 – Successful Logon  
            - Shows successful logon attempts  
            - Screenshot saved as: `/screenshots/4624.png`  
            - Log saved in: `/logs/4624-log.evtx`

       ✅ Event ID 4672 – Special Privileges Assigned  
            - Shows accounts assigned admin privileges on logon  
            - Screenshot saved as: `/screenshots/4672.png`  
            - Log saved in: `/logs/4672-log.evtx`

       ✅ Event ID 4625 – Failed Logon  
            - Captures failed login attempts (brute force tracking)  
            - Screenshot saved as: `/screenshots/4625.png`  
            - Log saved in: `/logs/4625-log.evtx`

|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Brute Force Login Detection      | Multiple failed logins using Event ID 4625                 |
| Successful Login After Brute Force | Tracked using Event ID 4624 after many 4625 entries      |
| Failed Login Threshold Tracking  | Users with 05+ failed logins per day using Event ID 4625   |
